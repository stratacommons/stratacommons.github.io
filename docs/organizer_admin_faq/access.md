One of our owners can't access StrataCommons on their computer (phone, laptop, tab etc.)  What's wrong?

In every case to date, we've discovered that users with access difficulties involves the terms of service.   Once your admin has set a user up on the Organizer, the system will send that user a welcome email.

When the user clicks on the link, they go to our sign on page but must complete the process.  So far, 100% of users with sign on problems haven't done this.

 We suggest you resend the welcome email to that individual.  Once they've accepted the terms and created a password (basically completed the sign on process) they should not have any problems.
