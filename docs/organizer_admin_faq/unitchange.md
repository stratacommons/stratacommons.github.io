### How to change a unit number.

*We've had an owner move to another unit in the building.  How do we change that on the directory?*

Click the **Directory** service on the main screen:

A new screen opens (the default is **People** showing all the owners in your strata.)  Click on the name you wish to change and another screen opens.

Their personal information screen opens and you may click on **Edit person**.

The edit screen opens.

and you can use the drop down box **Unit** to change your unit number.  When youâ€™re done, click on **Update owner**.

When you set up your strata, you had the opportunity to create a strata numbering scheme.  If the new number is not in the **Unit** dropdown box please refer to the How to section on changing your strata number scheme after the fact.
