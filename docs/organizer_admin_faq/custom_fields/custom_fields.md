# Customise the directory.

*Our strata wants to track key fobs and parking spots for units.  How do we do this?*

After you've logged in you'll find yourself on the **Conversation page.**  On the main menu, click on **Admin**.

A new window opens and you may click **Edit strata.**  

![choose edit](custom_fields/chooseedit.png)

Your strata details form now opens and if you scroll to the bottom of the form, after **Province,**  you'll see a header called **Custom fields for units.**

As a default, we have entered **Parking stall # Key Fob, License, Locker and Emergency contact** in the next fields but you may change this to anything you might want.  Enter the text you wish and then click the box beside it that says **Public**.

You've got nine custom fields that you can set up for parking stalls, key fobs, pets etc.  Once you've set up the fields you want, click on **Update strata** and you return to your strata's main information page under **Admin.**

You may now add your custom data for individual units using the directory service.
