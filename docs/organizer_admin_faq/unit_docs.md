# How to attach documents to a unit.

*We've had an owner submit an alteration and indemnity agreement to make a significant change to the strata.  How do we track this for future form B's?*

Use the usual process (see help files) for loading a document into the library.  

![go library](unitdocs/golib.png)

In that process, mark the document as part of the category **Council** and uncheck the **visible to group** box.

![set up](unitdocs/setupdoc.png)

Save the document as usual and then choose the **Directory** service.

![go directory](unitdocs/godir.png)

When the main directory screen opens, choose **Units** and the unit screen opens.

![go unit](unitdocs/gounit.png)

The **Unit** screen will open and you should click on the particular unit number (not the owner's name) you to which you wish to attach the document.

![choose unit](unitdocs/unitno.png)

The individual unit information screen opens and you may click on **Edit unit.**

![edit unit](unitdocs/editunit.png)

The edit screen opens and you may click on **Related documents**.   

![related docs](unitdocs/reldocs.png)

A drop down box opens showing the most recent files loaded in the **Library**.  Click on the document you wish to attach to the unit and then click on **Update unit** and the document is attached.  Only members of council and the owner may see these and they will show up in the Form B production process for a new owner.
