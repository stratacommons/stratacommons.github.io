# Document size and number

*Is there any size limitation for file uploads to the library?*

Yes 10MB per document - no document limit.  One needs to be careful when scanning large documents to use a low dots per inch (DPI) setting.  For example, our depreciation report at 1200 DPI scanner level is 20 MB.   At a 300 DPI, the same document was 1.1 MB.
