# Inappropriate conversation or document postings.

*Can we stop owners from uploading a document or making an inappropriate posting?*

The simple answer is no by design.  The system gives users the right to start a conversation or load a document.  As the strata admin you have system permission to remove any documents or conversations.  If other users feel the item is inappropriate, they can express their concern using the Flagging process - see FAQ.
