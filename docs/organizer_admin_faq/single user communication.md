####*Request Service*

####How does your software handle single user (non-group) communication?

We've created a service called requests available on the main menu which allows an owner to register a work order for example or other one off type questions.  This is then forwarded to the group responsible (which may also be an individual - groups can have one person in them.)  Our biggest use of this is with gardening or facilities related requests. 

In general, the principle behind the Organizer is group communication and the creation of a corporate record.  It is not meant to be a replacement for an email service so there are no options for individual conversation.  Most stratas use owners' home email for such things.
