# Locking the Directory

*Can we lock certain information in the directory so owners can't change it?*

No, we designed the software so owners could update their own personal information which makes them responsible for its accuracy.  There are a couple of exceptions and owners will have to contact their Admin to change.

There is a Condominium Home Owners Association form available that you might use that has owners sign off how they want to receive official communication and documentation from the strata.  Once they've signed this and indicated that email is their choice, they can't legally change how they receive official documentation without also changing that form.  This gives you some measure of control.

We're in the process of setting the email field as unchangeable, and when an owner tries to make a change, a flag comes up asking the individual to contact their admin.
