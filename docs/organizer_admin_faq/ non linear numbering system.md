####How do I enter unit numbers for a strata that has a non linear numbering system?  

**For example, we have 40 units and the numbers are floor based so level one has units 101 to 111, level two has 201 to 211 and so on.**

When you set up your strata,  youll see a screen that lets you set the start and end unit numbers for your whole strata or start and end numbers floor by floor.  (You can also add additional floors.)  In this case you should use the floor by floor method.
