# General Information

## Forum Purpose

The purpose of this web application is to make information readily available and facilitate communication in the larger strata community.  It does this by providing a place for conversations, a calendar of events, a business directory and a library with documents and web sites.  The Forum is meant for hands on practical day to day issues a council or property manager might face.  These may include questions about a particular service provider, references for a good landscaper, the best lawyer etc.  If you have questions concerning bylaws, the act, the Tribunal and other such concerns, please contact the Vancouver Island Strata Owner's Association, the Condominium Home Owner's Association or a strata lawyer.

## Basic Conventions

**Bolded** paragraph text represents titles, boxes or buttons in the software.  Paragraph text in *italics* is for emphasis.

## Browsers

After testing most available browsers, all work well including Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, Edge and Safari.  Users should know that all browsers have settings that control how files are displayed on their screen and or downloaded on their machine.  StrataCommons does not control these settings.

## Software Responsive to Design

The software is "responsive to design" and its appearance will change depending on the size of the browser display on your web application.  These help files assume you are using a full (or 2/3 full) screen web browser program (Explorer, Chrome etc.) on your desktop or laptop computer.  Those using a hand held device will need to click on the "hamburger" icon on the right to show menus.

## First Time Log in

You may sign on at https://stratacommons.ca/forum/sign_up.  To protect your privacy, the web application will ask you to set your password on this screen.  Please check off the boxes giving StrataCommons Forum the right to send you email and indicating you accept the agreements for use. You will also be asked to indicate your primary geographic area of interest.

### Note

Once you've logged on, you may return to the Forum by typing in https://stratacommons.ca/forum/messages in your web browser and press enter.  The site will remember you and you will not have to re-enter your credentials when you return.  We suggest you create a book mark in your browser.  You can also type in www.stratacommons.ca and you will go to our web site and click on Forum.

### Forgetting a Password

If a you forget your password, there is a reset password feature in the software.  After you click on **Sign in** on the StrataCommons Forum web page, click on **Forgot password?** under the **Log in** button.  A **Reset your password** box opens asking you to enter the email you use for StrataCommons Forum (most likely your home email.)  After you have entered your email address, click on "Send me the email."  StrataCommons will send an email to your email account with a link that you should click on.  This will take you to a StrataCommons page asking you to enter a new password.  The link has a time limit.

### Logging Off

You may simply close your browser window and then if you return to the website within a couple of days, you will be logged back in automatically. If you want to permanently log off the site, click on your user name in the right hand top corner and select the option to **Log out**.  If you return to the site you will have to re-enter your credentials.

## The Conversation Service

The first screen that appears when you enter the web application is the main conversation service. The service defaults to your chosen geographic area of interest showing posts with the most recent at the top.  

The conversation area serves as a way to organize StrataCommons Forum related communications in one place.

The main conversation screen is divided into two parts.  On the left under the title of **Conversation** are all of the communications available for your review.

On the right hand side of the screen you will see a button to create a new conversation and underneath that a heading called Filter conversations which allows you to control what you see in the left column.

![signon](scforum/conversation1.png)

### Starting a Conversation

Clicking on the **Start a new conversation** button found on the top right hand side of the screen, will open the new conversation box.  Once the new mail screen opens, there is a **Cancel** button on the right hand top if you change your mind.

The new conversation box contains several choices.

#### Title

Fill in a title for your message by clicking on this box.  This is similar to the *re:* used in most written communication.

#### Category

Click your mouse in the box under **Category** and a list of all of the strata topics available to you will appear.  Choose one as close to your topic as possible.  If you need more topics, send your system administrator a suggestion.  This helps those searching the posts to narrow down what might be of interest.

#### Message.

Fill in your text and the box will expand as needed.  You may format your conversation using *mark down* language which you may learn about by clicking on the **Formatting help** letters at the bottom right of the box but this is optional.

#### Location

Clicking the box that says **location** allows you to choose how far your conversation should be distributed.  So for example, if you want to know about good landscape gardeners in your immediate area choose your local town or regional district.  If the area is province wide choose British Columbia.

#### Related Documents.

You may attach a file to your conversation by placing your cursor in the **related documents** box. By default, the most recent documents loaded in the **Library** appear in date order.  As well, if the file is already in the Forum library, you may find the file by typing the first few letters of the name, group or category until the right file shows up.  As you type, the most recent files on the website will appear to a maximum of 10 that match your search criteria.  

You may also upload a new file if you wish by clicking on **upload a new document**.  This screen has a number of options for your use which include:

#### Upload a File

Clicking on **Choose File** will open a file manager showing your computer filing system.  Navigate through your file manager to find the document you wish to upload.  

#### Note

You may only load PDF files to ensure others can read the material in their web browser.  Most browsers have a built in PDF viewer that will work well.  Word processor files can not be read on the screen.

#### Description

Click in the **Description** box and enter a one or two sentence detailed description of the document to help other users know if this is the document that will be of most assistance to them.

At the bottom of these choices, there is an **upload new document ** button.  Click on this and StrataCommons Forum will upload your document and take you back to the **Post conversation** screen with the document loaded in the **Related documents** box.  

#### Note

Uploading a new document will also add this document to the Library service as well.

#### Post message.

Finally, click on this button to post your conversation or comments.  

![signon](scforum/conversation2.png)

### Adding Comments

You may participate in a conversation by clicking on the box "**more...** listed under the message." A new screen opens showing you the original posting and a text box allowing you to type in your comment and post it.  Other comments are posted beneath the comment box.

![signon](scforum/conversation3.png)

### Inappropriate Conversation or Comment

Once you've clicked on the **More** box and opened the conversation, you'll see that every conversation and comment includes the option of clicking on a box with **Flag** and a flag icon located beneath the conversation or comment.  The screen will change and a notice appears **We flagged the message and will review it.**  The system will alert the moderator(s) who will review the comment according to the **Rules of the Road** document.  If they agree the comment is inappropriate, the comment will be removed and a note posted that this has happened.  If an individual persists in posting inappropriate comments, their account may be cancelled.

![signon](scforum/library4.png)

Many owners may not have the necessary software to read a file created by a new version of Microsoft Word for example.

#### Override Creation Date

Articles are listed by the date they are uploaded to the library with the most recent at the top of the list.  If for some reason, you wish to change this, you may enter a new creation date.  This is most often used when you have an historical document and you want the date in the library to match the date of the document's origin not the date it was uploaded.
